# Modeling Crevasse Growth and Interactions in Glaciers Using Phase Field Fracture with Accept-Reject Adaptive Mesh Refinement
- **Motivation:**  
    Rising sea levels due to glacier and ice sheet mass loss highlight the need to understand crevasse growth and interaction â€” complex processes not yet fully understood.
    
- **Challenge:**  
    Variational phase-field fracture models (PFMs) are powerful for simulating fracture processes but are computationally expensive, especially for large-scale glacier simulations.
    
- **Objective:**  
    To develop an efficient and accurate method for modeling crevasse growth and interaction in glaciers using an adaptive approach.
    
- **Method:**
    
    - Introduced a **stress-based phase-field fracture model**.
        
    - Implemented a novel **accept-reject adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)** algorithm to reduce computational cost.
        
    - Simulated both **single and multiple crevasse propagation** in 2D and 3D domains.
        
- **Key Findings:**
    
    - The AMR method efficiently captures complex fracture behaviors with reduced computational effort.
        
    - **Ocean pressure** plays a restrictive role in crevasse growth.
        
    - **Spacing between crevasses** significantly affects their propagation and interaction patterns.
        
- **Contribution:**
    
    - Demonstrates a   efficient numerical framework for glacier fracture simulation.
    - Provides new insights into crevasse dynamics relevant to predicting ice mass loss and sea-level rise
