In this section, Im gonna to implement 3D single crack simulations. Below is the problem setup. The domain has size of 750 m x 500 m x125 m, and is subjected a gravity. The right surface is subjected a hydrostatic pressure caused by water. In this study, we select the level of water (hw = 0.0, 0.5 and 0.5) to see how it impact the crack behavior. The top surface is free. Other surfaces are applied roller BCs as below:
